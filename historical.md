# SubstitutionCipher
<h1>Substitution Cipher </h1>
<p>Substitution cipher is a type of cryptography that takes plaintext or language and puts it into coded language/cipher text</p>
<h1>Historical Context</h1>
<p>Substitution cipher can date back all the way to something called the Atbash cipher that created substitutions in the Hebrew language. It was a simple way of encoding using the same ciphertext alphabet and was really just reversing the plaintext alphabet.</p>
<p>Later on, a new substitution cipher was used by Julius Caesar known as the Caesar Cipher. This was slightly more secure than the Atbash and shifted the alphabet down 3 (A=D, B=E, etc.). Caesar used this method to communicate to his armies on the battlefield.</p>
<h2>Pigpen Cipher</h2>

<p> The Pigpen Cipher (pictured above) was the first recorded cipher to use symbols instead of just changing the existing alphabet. Pigpen was used by many different groups, including union soldiers held prisoner by the confederacy during the civil war.</p>
