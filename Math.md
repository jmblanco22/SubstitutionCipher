A simple example of a substitution cipher is called the Caesar cipher, sometimes called a shift cipher. In this approach, each letter is replaced with a letter some fixed number of positions later in the alphabet. For example, if we use a shift of 3, then the letter A would be replaced with D, the letter 3 positions later in the alphabet. The entire mapping would look like: [1]
