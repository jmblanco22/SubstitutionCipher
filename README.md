# Final Analysis
We learned that the Substitution cipher can date back all the way to something called the Atbash cipher that created substitutions in the Hebrew language. It was a simple way of encoding using the same ciphertext alphabet and was really just reversing the plaintext alphabet. Additionally, in substitution cipher, units of plaintext are replaced with ciphertext. Lastly, we learned about the code and how we had to substitute each letter in the message to the letter of the alphabet in reverse.
